My database backup is with the name yiisite.sql.
*I have done the things you asked me to do, i.e id and date fields are not showing
to user now but still the data can be added in db table (user can't see that going inside
the table). The notes are separated with the dates( date when the note is created).
*Notes can be viewed via ListView now.
